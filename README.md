# Schaumi
### A game about a robo vacuum finding its way through a dungeon to clean all the dust.

This is a game made using the [defold engine](https://www.defold.com) for the [Open Jam 2018](https://itch.io/jam/open-jam-2018) with the theme: SPAM TO WIN!.

The player has to control our robot vacuum protagonist "Schaumi" through various levels with the mouse, while simultaneously getting spammed with verses of Goethes Faust that have to be removed by typing.
